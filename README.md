# Attrition_DataAnalysis
This project analyzes employee attrition patterns using both data visualization and machine learning.

# OBJECTIVES:
#1. Analyze HR data: To identify primary factors driving high churn rates.

#2. Develop tailored retention strategies: To address attrition drivers and improve employee satisfaction.

#3. Provide Development Opportunities: Focus on enhancing diversity and identifying growth opportunities.


# DATA INSIGHTS & RECOMMENDATIONS

### Insight #1: Younger professionals demonstrate higher Attrition rates in seeking alternative career opportunities and personal growth.

Action: Empower younger professionals through mentorship programs, flexible work arrangements, professional development opportunities, recognition initiatives, and effective feedback mechanisms, fostering their career growth, satisfaction, and retention within the organization.


### Insight #2: Lower incomes correlate with elevated Attrition rates.

Action: Conduct a comprehensive compensation analysis to ensure fair pay, enhance benefits packages for lower-income employees, implement career pathing programs, develop engagement initiatives, and offer mentorship and coaching opportunities to support career growth and retention.


### Insight #3: Lower Job Satisfaction among employees contributes to elevated attrition rates.

Action: Implement measures to address low job satisfaction, including regular surveys, addressing root causes, providing training and development opportunities, improving communication channels, and implementing recognition programs, to mitigate attrition rates associated with dissatisfaction.


### Insight #4: Single individuals tend to exhibit higher attrition rates due to factors such as lack of dependents, social flexibility, desire for work-life balance, and pursuit of career advancement opportunities.

Action: Implement initiatives such as flexible work arrangements, career development programs, recognition and rewards, supportive culture building, and work-life integration strategies to address high attrition rates among single employees.


### Insight #5: Among the departments, the HR department exhibits notably higher attrition rates.

Action: Mitigate high attrition in departments through workload assessment, career development, employee support, culture enhancement, and leadership training.

# WHY THESE MODELS?

• Diverse Approaches: The classification task can be approached in a variety of ways by utilizing both Random Forest and Logistic Regression. While Logistic Regression produces a linear decision boundary that is easy to understand and interpret, Random Forest uses an ensemble of decision trees to capture intricate relationships between features.

• Model Performance: Random Forest and Logistic Regression are well-known for their consistent results when applied to a variety of datasets and classification tasks.

• Interpretability vs. Complexity: Results from Logistic Regression are easily understood, with distinct coefficients showing how each feature affects the prediction. However, Random Forest provides a higher level of complexity when it comes to ensemble learning, which makes it a useful method of capturing nonlinear correlations and interactions between data.
